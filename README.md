### Getting Started Data Import
we began by importing our data from our online data source kaggle into a new datafram to manipulate
### Functions and Cleaning
Finding many issues with our dataframe we felt best to perform some preprocessing on the dataframe
### Popularity Machine Learning Model Analysis
After cleaning and performing some preprocessing of our data, we began to analyze
### Genre Machine Learning Model Analysis
Next we determined that based upon our data we could see if it might be better to predict genre based on a song's information
### Summary
In conclusion, we determined
